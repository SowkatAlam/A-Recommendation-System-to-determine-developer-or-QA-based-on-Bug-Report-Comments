Resolved as WORKSFORME.
Chris Saari fixed a bug like this last week
Assigned to matt.
Matt, can you figure out who whacked the XUL here?
This should be fixed on GTK now.
I'll fix windows as soon as I get a successful build.
This was technically a different bug. Before it infinitely added to the
submenus.
Now it just doubled them.
Fixed.
