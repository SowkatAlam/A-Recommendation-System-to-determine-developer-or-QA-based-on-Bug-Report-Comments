Still happening 15.Jun.99. Why this is _my_ bug, and not someone in Layout's, I
have no idea.
But I'll look at it more closely later.  Not today, though.  It's a minor bug. 
Postponing.
Rude of me to reassign this bug after it's been sitting in my lap for eight
months.
But here goes. Hey Eric -- this is clearly not a *window* bug; it's something
in layout.
The problem is, if you horizontally shrink the browser window until it's
narrower than
the menubar, the content area won't refresh when you size the window wider,
until you've
once again extended past the menubar. This seems to be Windows-specific.
  I'm thinking it might be a box thing, but only on general principle. Feel
like taking a look?s
