this also happens when you delete a message.  The delete part is causing both
bugs, so there's no need to file a bug on that as well
Bug 5513 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug
I just checked in the fix that will prevent this from crashing.  However, it
will now just do nothing.  Chris Waterson is going to check in a fix that will
fix this.  Though, even if he does fix this, this bug is occurring because I
can't handle the case where a message is created without a folder or
nsIDBMsgHdr.  I need to have a way to create these on the fly instead of
expecting them to always exist
This was fixed last night.  It should be in today's builds
I need to work on this tomorrow.  I'm having trouble reproducing what I wrote
above on my machine at home and now I need to pull a bunch of stuff to be able
to compile.  So, this isn't going to make it by midnight.
I still can't reproduce this on my machine at home.  But I'm seeing other
strange refcounting problems related to deleting.  I need to spend some time on
this today.  My guess is that changing DeleteHeader in nsMsgDatabase will be
part of the changes.
Oops.  You won't be able to verify this bug until the move menu is fixed.
However, you can test the delete bug.
So many questions!  I just filed bug #5510.  Alec is going to work on it
Sorry, I just meant that it shouldn't be reopened because we haven't proved
that
move doesn't work.  I still believe the fix is valid which is why I marked it
fixed again.  When the move menu bug is fixed, then we can safely say this bug
has been verified or reopened.
