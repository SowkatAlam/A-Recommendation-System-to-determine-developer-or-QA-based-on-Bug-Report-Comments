I talked to Greg this morning, he is working on the Ender side change.
The current plan is let Ender to return nsString with (UCS2). Since my change
was needed for Ender to do a charset conversion, it's not needed for the current
plan.
Greg, my change is ready and reviewed. When do you think your change is ready?
Do you think it's going to make M5?
Although my change is separated from Ender, I was told to check in with your
change so that this bug can be verified.
Completed checkin with changes to OutputText and OutputHTML.
Reassigning back to Nhotta. I believe that the Ender work is done, but I need
Naoki to confirm that the work is done as required.
Accepting bug.
Adding ducarroz@netscape.com to cc because he is the owner of
nsComposeAppCore.cpp.
I found that we cannot change SendMessage to use char* because it is accessible
by JavaScript, we need unicode here. Ender need to implement nsString version
(i.e. current inteface) correctly.
I still need to change nsComposeAppCore.cpp for charset menu, that's related but
a separate change from Ender's change.
