Analysis of bug reports and bug report comments largely depends on many machine learning techniques. This system focuses on those machine learning techniques for recommending commenter role by analyzing bug report comments. The main goal was to create a recommendation system that can recommend whether a commenter is a developer or tester. In this work, I used Mozilla bug report comments as the data set. Those comments were written in plain text. Then, I used a classifier for training and testing purposes. The results of various experiments are very promising. The results showed that the recommendation system achieved precision of 87.5%, recall of 77.78%, and F-measure of 82.35%, whereas the random role recommendation approach (this approach was performed separately by selecting commenter role randomly) was able to achieve precision of 57.14%, recall of 44.44%, and F-measure of 50.0%.
