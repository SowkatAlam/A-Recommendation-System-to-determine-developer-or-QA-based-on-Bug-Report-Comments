Looks like we are treating this bug the same as bug #5513 as a Delete crash bug.
All right.  I'll verify it because it does not crash upon Delete on both Linux
and win_nt 4.0
From menu Message, select Move Message, no sub-menu is displayed. Looks like
the move option is disabled. Reopen bug
Moving message to another folder and deleting message no longer causes
application to crash any more.
But...
On Linux build (1999-04-27-08)
Both deleting and moving message to another folder still crashes.
Reopen this bug and change it
