I'm going to mark this fix verified for now.
I tried to input somewhat long messages using the JPN IME
but this is extremely difficult to do because of severe
IME/Editor bugs. It is not just productive to test this further
given the state of the IME/Editor for M6.
When I could input 2-3 lines of Japanese text (nearly impossible to
do without an error by the way), I've confirmed that whatever I put
in went out and arrived at the recipient's mailbox without truncation
or disappearing.
There could be something else wrong with this but we should wait
until either 1) we can paste in Japanese text properly, 2)IME.Editor
bugs get resolved and we can input more easily.
Marking the fix verified for now.
Adding to QA Blocker radar.

What I meant was "M5" above.
