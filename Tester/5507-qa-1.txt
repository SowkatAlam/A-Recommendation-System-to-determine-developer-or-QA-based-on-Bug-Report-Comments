build id: 1999042608
platforms this happens on: windows nt, mac os 8.5.1
(linux crashes before opening the file)
to reproduce this, select open from the file menu and open a local file. result:
the file opens, but in a new window.
expected result: the file opens in the current browser window.
for the record, legacy Netscape browsers and IE all open local files in the
spawning window, ie the window from which file | open was selected. given that
this behavior is expected by (I assume) nearly all users, we should probably
keep it in 5.0...
I'm reopening this bug in hopes of getting the UI team to implement File | Open
in the same manner it's implemented in previous versions of Communicator and in
current versions of IE.
Moving all Apprunner bugs past and present to Other component temporarily
whilst
don and I set correct component.  Apprunner component will be deleted/retired
shortly.
