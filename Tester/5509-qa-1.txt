Moving all Apprunner bugs past and present to Other component temporarily
whilst
don and I set correct component.  Apprunner component will be deleted/retired
shortly.
Updating QA Contact.
i'm able to consistently reproduce this on both windows and linux using this
morning's build (the 1999042608 build as reported earlier). therefore, I believe
that this is still a problem. reopening bug.
